1. Why did you choose the tools, libraries, and language you used for the coding exercise?
  -The reason I chose C++ for this task is due to my strong background in the language and my experience implementing data structures in C++.
C++ offers a wide range of data structures to choose from, such as dynamic allocation, singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, binary search trees, and more.

  -I chose to use a doubly linked list because it allows us to add, retrieve, and delete elements anywhere in the list. This can be crucial when
wanting to pull a customer's transactions from a past time. Overall, using a doubly linked list boosts efficiency by performing tasks in constant time while keeping everything organized.

  -I didn't know how to implement a REST API, so I used AI as an alternative. It guided me to create a "simulation" where the code is controlled from there. Overal, my code completes the tasks given and returns the correct test results.

2. What are the advantages and disadvantages of your solution?
  Advantage
  -Destructor 
  -Double linked list
  -Flexible
  Disadvantage
  -Memory consumption
  -Complex management

3. What has been a favorite school/personal project thus far? What about it that challenged you?
  -My favorite project in my CS career has been creating a lightning strike calculator. It wasn't particularly challenging, but I enjoyed it because I applied what I knew from studying computer science and physics to answer a real-life question I often asked myself while watching lightning strikes.
