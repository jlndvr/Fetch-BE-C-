1. Why did you choose the tools, libraries, and language you used for the coding exercise?
  -I chose C++ for this task due to my strong background in the language and my experience implementing data structures in C++. C++ offers a wide range of data structures, such as dynamic allocation, singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, binary search trees, and more.

  -I opted for a doubly linked list because it allows us to add, retrieve, and delete elements anywhere in the list efficiently. This capability is crucial for tasks like pulling a customer's past transactions. Using a doubly linked list enhances efficiency by performing tasks in constant time while keeping everything organized.

  -Since I was unfamiliar with implementing a REST API, I asked AI for an alternative. It guided me to create a "simulation" where the code is controlled from there. Overall, my code completes the tasks given and returns the correct test results.

2. What are the advantages and disadvantages of your solution?
  Advantage
   -Destructor 
   -Doubly linked list
   -Flexible
  Disadvantage
   -Memory consumption
   -Complex management

3. What has been a favorite school/personal project thus far? What about it that challenged you?
  -My favorite project in my CS career has been creating a lightning strike calculator. It wasn't particularly challenging, but I enjoyed it because I applied what I knew from studying computer science and physics to answer a real-life question I often asked myself while watching lightning strikes.
